      <description>The case I was trying to record the screen and sound with a laptop Avell (Clevo in Brazil). This laptop has I5 processor, and a hybrid video card (intel and Nvidia 1050), with Pop!_OS Linux distro and Gnome. All was quite fine for while, but after install Kazam (it is a great Software) I could not run it. Why? Because the icon systray was removed from Gnome and the plugin Top icon did not work.</description>
