      <description>Introduction The work in data science must be tidy. A simple file name can help you to save a lot of time. For instance, if you have a series of satellite images from LANDSAT 8, the files are ordered by Julian date:
rt@rt-d5567:~/Documents/$ find -name &#39;*305*.TIF&#39; ./LO82280702018305CUB00_B3.TIF ./LO82280702018305CUB00_B9.TIF ./LO82280702018305CUB00_B5.TIF  If you did not realize, note that after 2018 there are three numbers 305. The number 305 means the 305th day of the year.</description>

      <description>Introduction If you want to predict the amount of rainfall, yield crops, or other attribute , you may need to learn about the interpolation methods like inverse distance weighted (IDW).
IDW is a deterministic method for interpolation, once you have a set of know points, you can use IDW to estimate values for unknown points. For instance, you have 6 know points with rainfall attribute, and you need to predict the rainfall for a 7th point (Figure 1).</description>

      <description>I am an EMACS user and consequently I use the amazing Org mode to plan my schedule and to manage my projects. However I was boring about how I synchronized the .ics file from EMACS and my Google calendar. I spent some minutes in my Google calendar to clear the appointments, and import a new file. So, a while ago I improved my routine. I did know nothing about it.</description>
