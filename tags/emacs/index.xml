      <description>Usually I prepare some personal reports and some shorts analysis as well. The Jupyter-Notebook is an amazing tool, however sometimes I just wanna a simple plain text. I use EMACS org-mode to organize my agenda and to manage my projects. So, Why not use org-mode tables in EMACS?&#xA;At the begin I thought it was complicate, but actually not. With source code blocks in EMACS is possible to run several languages.</description>

      <description>Introduction Every day I open EMACS to check my tasks and my schedule. Once I was wondering, why not plan and control my research projects. I checked some sites site 1, site 2, and site 3 and it was piece of cake. I split in 4 steps.&#xA;Step 1 - prepare your org file Prepare a .org file like this:&#xA;* PROJECTS :PROPERTIES: :COLUMNS: %6TYPE %20ITEM %OWNER %13DEADLINE :TYPE_ALL: Proj Action :OWNER_ALL: Person1 Person2 :Approved_ALL: &amp;#34;[ ]&amp;#34; &amp;#34;[X]&amp;#34; :DONE_ALL: Yes Nop :END: ** PROJECT 1 :PROPERTIES: :TYPE: Pesq :END: *** TODO Action 1 [33%] :PROPERTIES: :OWNER: Person1 :DEADLINE: &amp;lt;2018-05-20 Fri&amp;gt; :DONE: Nop :END: - [X] Version 1 - [ ] Version 2 *** TODO Action 2 [33%] :PROPERTIES: :OWNER: Person2 :DEADLINE: &amp;lt;2018-07-20 Fri&amp;gt; :DONE: Nop :END: - [X] Version 1 - [ ] Version 2 Step 2 - Almost there Once your file is done, you can check it in column-view, just press C-c C-x C-c on PROJECT1.</description>

      <description>I am an EMACS user and consequently I use the amazing Org mode to plan my schedule and to manage my projects. However I was boring about how I synchronized the .ics file from EMACS and my Google calendar. I spent some minutes in my Google calendar to clear the appointments, and import a new file. So, a while ago I improved my routine. I did know nothing about it.</description>
